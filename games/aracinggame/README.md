# Racing Game

A simple Racing Game where you drive rounds on a track and try to reach a highscore in form of the best time to complete.

## Dependencies

+ python
+ pygame


## How to Run

+ Run `python game.py`

## Controls

+ Esc to leave the current scene/End the game in the Main Menu
+ W/S to move in the menu, options and Enter to confirm selection
+ To drive you can steer with A/D and use W to drive forwards and S to brake/reverse
+ To change gears you either use Q/E to go one down/up or just the numbers 1-6

## Rules

+ If you complete 3 rounds while passing the checkpoints you will end the game and can enter your name if you reached a new highscore
+ If you drive into the lake or mountains your car crashes resulting in a game over
+ If you drive on the grass you will get slowed down


## Files and functions

    + `input_expected(screen,pressed_keys)`: draws text,waits for player to press Space
    + `start_timer(screen,pressed_keys)`: stops you from pressing s, rpm can already go up, show timer going down
    + `show_go(screen, pressed_keys)`: starts timer, draws GO
    + `game_running(screen, pressed_keys)`: lets you drive around, checks for ground, checkpoints, gear
    + `game_over(screen,pressed_keys)`: draws game over text, lets you restart

## Challenges

The Challenges are marked with HACKATHON CHALLENGE x in the code. Press ctrl+f and search in the code "game.py" to find the place to implement. The challenges don't need to be done in the order they appear, but are recommended in this order. <br />


### HACKATHON CHALLENGE 1

**Storyüöó:** Someone stole the watch of the timekeeper! Build a new one for him so he can keep track of the scores again. <br />
  

**Task:** *Build a Timer.* A timer should be displayed on the screen when the game is started to keep track of the time score.

**Learning goal:** Think about how to convert a given time in milliseconds into the string format.

**File:** `game.py`

**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê <br />
<details>
  <summary>üîê Hints</summary>
  <details>
  <summary>Hint 1</summary>
  
  - Use modulo (%) to extract the remainder when calculating milliseconds, seconds, and minutes.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>
  
  - Use Python‚Äôs `str.format()` or `f-strings` to neatly format the time as MM:SS:MMM.
  </details> 
</details>  


### HACKATHON CHALLENGE 2

**Storyüöó:** Oh No! Speedy McZoom broke his hand when he tried to stop the robber of the watch, and now he can't drive his car anymore. Help him by adding an automatic mode for the car so he doesn't need to shift gears anymore! <br />

**Task:** *Automatic mode.* Add an automatic mode to the car and display the text in the options' menu.  The automatic mode should shift gears based on speed so Speedy McZoom can continue driving without manual shifting.<br />
  

**Learning goal:** Understand how to use conditions to modify behavior based on state (automatic vs manual).

**File:** `game.py`,`car.py`

**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê <br />

<details>
  <summary>üîê Hints</summary>
  <details>
  <summary>Hint 1</summary>

  - Use a boolean variable (gearSetting) to manage the state (manual or automatic).
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>
  
  - Update the car‚Äôs behavior dynamically using conditional logic (if car['automatic']:).
  </details> 

  <details>
  <summary>Hint 3</summary>

  - Note the role of the function `automatic(car, set=None)` in `car.py` when generating the car object in `game.py`.  

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>Hint 4</summary>

  - Use the speed to determine gear changes: 
    - Shift up if speed exceeds the maximum for the current gear. 
    - Shift down if speed falls below 50% of the maximum and gear > 1.

### Bonus Challenge 1

**Storyüöó:** While driving the car, it gets confusing if the car is moving forward or backward.

**Task:** *Checkpoint Reminder*. Implement a feature to display a text reminder and a sound reminder when the car near a checkpoint. <br />

**Learning goal:** Think about why you need checkpoint reminder. Observe the generation of checkpoints and changes in the number of laps played. Look for underlying game rules and logic.  <br />
